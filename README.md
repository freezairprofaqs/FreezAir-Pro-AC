**What Extreme Heat Does to the Human Body;**
---------------------------------------------

The healthy human body maintains its internal temperature around 37°C. Variations, usually of less than 1°C, occur with the time of the day, level of physical activity or emotional state. A change of body temperature of more than 1°C occurs only during illness or when environmental conditions are more than the body's ability to cope with extreme heat. Exposure limits developed by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists for heat stress are based on maintaining the core body temperature within one 1ºC of normal (37ºC).

As the environment warms-up, the body tends to warm-up as well. The body's internal "thermostat" maintains a constant inner body temperature by pumping more blood to the skin and by increasing sweat production. In this way, the body increases the rate of heat loss to balance the heat burden. In a very hot environment, the rate of "heat gain" is more than the rate of "heat loss" and the body temperature begins to rise. A rise in the body temperature results in heat illnesses, which can be very serious.

Therefore, it is always important to maintain the internal body temperature in normal level during any environmental condition. During summer it is very difficult to face to the extreme hot weather. People adhere to different practices to reduce internal room temperatures.  The most common thing is the use of Air conditioners. But with the sky high electricity bill again it becomes an issue. And also most AC machines are not convenient.

In this review we introduce you the best solution for this serious issue. You don’t want to worry in the next summer.

**What Is** [**FreezAir Pro**](https://www.facebook.com/people/FreezAir-Pro/100093166323275/)**?**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 “FreezAir Pro” which is invented by Swiss experts from FreezAir is a portable compact AC device. We called it is an AC device because it is not a conventional AC. It is a cooling cartridge and it works as a humidifier, air purifier and an air cooler. Multiple tests have been conducted repeatedly by the Swiss engineers from this company to prove the functional properties of FreezAir Pro. FreezAir Pro makes use of “Hydro-Chill Technology” and “Dual Cooling Jets.” Therefore it is more efficient than the other devices of similar nature. This technology gets activated by adding moisture. After getting activated, FreezAir Pro is capable in turning hot air into the cold and moist air. Hydro-chill technology provides noteworthy cooling effects for several days depending on the external temperature conditions in the environment. Other than those features there are numerous other features that come with the FreezAir Pro.

**Key Specifications of FreezAir Pro:**
---------------------------------------

This revolutionary device provides four different fan speeds, such as low, medium, high and turbo to boost up cool air, especially during hot summer. Product testing has demonstrated that FreezAir Pro can be used for up to 8 hours on high speed, 10 hours on medium speed and 12 hours on low speed with the adjustable fan strength. Particularly, FreezAir Pro aids cooling in 30 seconds (not just in 10 seconds). Despite the wide range of controllable fan speeds, FreezAir Pros make low noise than most of the other air conditioners available to date. FreezAir Pro also has an adjustable vent to direct the airflow and this feature discrete FreezAir Pro from other conventional types. Most of the commercially available traditional room air conditioners are capable of regulating fan speed, and therefore they only have control over the number of air particles flowing at a time. Unlike FreezAir Pro, conventional air conditioners mostly cannot change the direction of the airflow. As a result, you have to stay in the direction of airflow with old-fashioned air conditions, whereas you can change the direction of airflow towards yourself with vent adjustable FreezAir Pro. The capacity of the water tank is also comparably high in FreezAir Pro having a 550 ml capacity.

Being portable and lightweight, FreezAir Pro makes life much better in summer. Even though there are many portable cooling devices that exist at preset, their cooling capacity is restricted by low battery power. FreezAir Pro consists of a long-lasting durable battery with a 2000mAh capacity. The type of battery used in FreezAir Pro is AC100-120V, DC5V, 1.5-2.0A Li-on. FreezAir Pro has a USB-C charging cable and charging of the device is possible equally both indoors as well as outdoors. Based on the type of charging sources, such as direct power or power bank, the average time takes to achieve a full charge state may vary. Approximately, FreezAir Pro takes about five hours to fully charge. The charging status of the device will be notified by an indicator light, where the blinking of the light indicates that charging is in progress. When ChillWell is at full charge, the light remains constant.

Another advanced feature that comes with FreezAir Pro is its LED night light chamber. This light chamber contains a broad spectrum of colors. For example, it has blue, red, white, teal, purple, yellow and green colors. Users have given an option to choose any color they want to display at night or else they can use the color cycle mode where every color in the chamber appears at continuous intervals. Interestingly, the color effect of FreezAir Pro does not affect its functions. Accordingly, FreezAir Pro works as an air cooler and humidifier both daytime and night with or without activating its color mode.

FreezAir Pro has a replaceable cooling cartridge. This cartridge is made up of sponge materials. Placing a water-soaked cooling cartridge or even feezed cooling cartridge in the unit initiates the cooling function of FreezAir Pro allowing people to CHILL OUT limitlessly wherever they go. The cooling tank can be easily filled with water as well as ice cubes. Upon filling, the cooling cartridge permits the moisture to evaporate and thereby reduces the heat. Based on the usage, it is recommended to replace the cartridge once every 1 - 3 months.

**FreezAir Pro Scam Alerts?** 
------------------------------

When you search FreezAir Pro in Google or another search engine, these sites show up something like, “FreezAir Pro genuine? FreezAir Pro Scam or Legit?” or “FreezAir Pro reviews: Scam or legit Air Conditioner” or something of that nature. This is often nothing more than an attempt to draw you into their site by making you think they used the product and had a really bad experience with it. These are fake and not real scam alerts or legitimate complaints. Because the title shows SCAM!!!!! Or a really horrible experience, but when we go to the page and read the review and it’s always an extremely positive, giving the idea about how great FreezAir Pro is. Therefore, they only use the word SCAM to try and draw you into their site because they know if they say something is a scam or a terrible program, you’ll probably click on their link to find out more about it, right? A legitimate bad experience or a real scam alert to help protect consumers is one thing, but don’t fall for this type of trickery and trust your gut when the headline/page title and review don’t match.
